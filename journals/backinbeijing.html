July 19 2025th. I'm back in Beijing. My coauthor flew me back and I'm staying with family for around 10 days, and home is great. 

I talked with many people. It's obvious that I'm looking for a new direction. I'm leaving the startup I'm now "cofounder" at once the product is launched, it's soulless. 
It made me think a bunch about human nature, mainly because they had lots of discussions on hacking human nature to get peoples attention or what not. In hindsight, it's degenerate and probably creates negative value to this world.
It was eye opening though. I never would have thought about that stuff myself.

Some senior people in semiconductors are looking for some new horizons since GPUs and what not use way too much power.
It's a good point. They believed quantum computing could change the game though, and they didn't know about the algorithms crisis in the field.
It reminded me how people outside the field really don't know much about it.
I told them about it but I don't think I was good at explaining it, so they probably stil believe quantum computing could be one of the next big things.
They are probably going to end up like particle accelerators, like another big machine to probe physics with. 
My coauthor and his students have some problems in quantum information they want to work on. I'd be up to help out, but my original motivation for quantum was quantum computing,
while they are mainly interested in the theory (and pessimistic about quantum computing working). 
I was also hopeful about quantum chemistry before. He mentioned that one of the top researchers in the field had lost hope in it for all kinds of reasons, and was signaling to people that the field was dying.
He got a lot of backlash for it.

For AI stuff I still think we will have use some form of inference to do training, and inference is a lot more power efficient. I'm less optimistic that I should
try to do this myself at this point in time. I think people with much more resources have caught on with some ideas in the same neighborhood with test time training and so on, and it could take us somewhere interesting.
All the next gen chips already have somewhat native support for stuff like lora based test time training. I don't know the details much
since it's not a game I can play. I still think meta-rl type stuff should come out of an inference company.

I also talked to someone who is working on stable coins. She did some major work at circle. and said that if she were in my position she would just
go straight for BCI. It was a good point. I was into it at some point like 2 years ago, but for some reason I thought for a long time that we should figure out how to do it
non invasively. Then I took a MEMS class with lin liwei in fall 2024, and realized that invasive was really the only way to go, and we would need some serious breakthroughs in sensors and stuff to get further.

I was thinking about the idea of selling out directly to bring in some money to work on something interesting, and crypto seemed a way to cash in fast.
I asked a friend of mine why he wanted to do something boring to make money, and he said because it was how capitalism works. I never thought deeply about capitalism before that.
I eventually reached the conclusion I should do something interesting straight up. I'm in a decent position. I can "retire" in China whenever I want, and not work a day in my life.
There's no point in selling out for me, my time at this startup has really taught me that it's not in my nature to do something I don't care about.

When I got into research because I wanted to do something interesting, and refused to do dirty work for a grad student and whatever else boring stuff they had in mind for me. It seems I had more resolve back then.
I asked my coauthor about his first paper. He told a story about how he was first into string theory, then realized the field was dying about half a year in, then switched to quantum information.
He chose his advisor because he was doing all kinds of really interesting stuff and was great to talk to, but his advisor didn't actually advise him much.
So he worked on some communication problem inspired by something he saw in the PRB theorem paper. I didn't really understand the details but he said something about the idea of using an infintely long message to communicate 0 information,
and how it was because it was fun and interesting, not that it was going to be useful for something. Scott Aaronson was also a collaborator on it. In hindsight, it was amazing to him that he could produce good research himself, and without much guidance
His second paper was a major hit and its his most cited paper to this day. He said it's kind of amazing the state people are in when they are new to the field and young, and it's hard to ever really get back to that state of mind.

I like the idea of neural prosthetics or replacement, like what Theodore Berger did. A new friend sent a talk by somebody and it mentioned his work in passing, and I looked a bit more into it.
I think we might be able to pull some ship of thesues type of thing with the brain, where we can replace parts of it while keeping self. Self is a great thing to have, and should never be given up.
Also, I think the first person to voluntarily amputate a limb or something and replace it with a prosthetic will come around within the next 15 years, and it will be a big deal.
I'm certain it won't be me.

I think hardware stuff will be interesting to do. It seems it doesn't take much to make a prototype and head to shenzhen to get it made, and theres all kinds of stuff to be made.

I also met up with another old friend from Defcon. He's in Beijing for a while. We talked about all kinds of stuff. What we shared was being a product of multiple cultures, or just kind of being outside of it.
I brought up how everyone talks about empathy or taking a different perspective but is terrible at it in practice. We also talked a ton about how everything people know is shaped pretty heavily. He also referenced some stuff I had never heard of, like the comic transmetropolitan and the invisibles and the game Nier automata. I don't know if it's because I'm too out of touch with what people are consuming or anything, but I should get around to doing some more consuming.
It's kind of strange to me that it seems consuming is so tiring. It seems other people really enjoy it. I feel anxious when doing so.
