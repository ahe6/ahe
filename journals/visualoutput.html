July 5th 2025: today we visited the pixar office and listened to many stories, and asked many questions. visual output takes a lot of time and effort, and text feels almost effortless in comparison.
Jobs was amazing in many ways and seemed to have some quite deep understanding of human nature. Pixar had a huge culture. It shaped people a lot, and for some people it was their whole life.
I have access to 8xh100s now, but it feels like nothing compared to what is needed to learn a policy for a good rl algorithm that will work on some of the huge models we use nowadays.
and theres a handful of new problems to think about now with how we should handle updatining the model weights fast and what not, especially in a distributed setting.
also, I recently realized how cheap bio is and have some ideas for how to do that.
