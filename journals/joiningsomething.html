    May 11th 2025. It has been longer than I intended since I wrote something here. my laptop stopped working. it took a while to get it fixed. 
    fortunately I still have around 2 months of warranty left. I renewed 2 more years of warranty and accident protection for 200 usd, 
    which is certainly cheaper than a new laptop.
    
    some stuff has happened since then. I joined an effort by a friend to work on a project as a "founding engineer".
    In other words, I work for free and get some equity. The main cofounder raised 36 million at his last startup,
    and he's connected to lots of people who are ready to give him money. I will hang around to gain some experience
    and see how things go. I now live in their living room, and most of the work is boring and quite far from my roots in ai for science.
    I am quite inexperienced in software engineering practices, but have picked up some stuff over the last few days 
    by doing stupid things and looking back to realize I could have done it way faster and better.
    the technical cofounder who has like 5 years of experience is worse at some things than I am, which is surprising. 
    He relies a lot on cursor (I think too much). I think this is dangerous, since cursor is not very good at many things.
    I still hand write a lot of my code cause I tried handing over control to cursor a few times and it didn't work out well.

    I'll probably stick around for a while. I should be in the bay area at least until mid June.
    something that I'm trying to get together with their project is being able to do more things with voice control.
    I can't quite explain it, but I think it's a lot less taxing for me to use voice over keyboard. I have a basic setup and its great to just talk
    and watch things happen on the tv. I can code for a lot longer without getting tired by using this sometimes, although many tasks are still poorly suited to this.
    I think computer co-use is going to come very soon, and it'll work a lot better since control can and should be handed over to the user anytime. 
    Also I prefer coding in bed much more than at a desk. I can work for like 3 hours at a desk until I'm burned out but I can work all day in bed.
    I wonder where many great discoveries were made. I think many more were made in a table than in a bed.

    also it was great to see this company launch some dictation tool byt a yc company called willow. 
    It seemed quite unpolished but I would have loved to subscribe to it and use it but they made it for macos,
    I don't like to use apple products, so I will build my own. Speaking of which
    I will probably be at yc's ai startup school, since I have never really been to such events before.
    I don't think it'll be very useful, nor do I care for networking.

    also, I am trying to push the people at joinodf to make a decision sooner.
    I had an interview scheduled with ari a while back at 8am but he cancelled it like 5 am the day we were supposed to meet. I found out at like 7:57am.
    The next time I could schedule was the next week, and it was with somebody else. Then we did the interview and he told me they would decide 
    in about 2 to 3 days. I sent 3follow up emails and they finally replied asking me to do a second final interview with ari. 
    I agreed, but his calendar didn't have any slots available for may and the program starts may 30th. 
    I emailed them back in like an hour that there were no slots available, and they haven't replied yet.
    They also want to charge like 1000usd for the program lol. I still don't think the program will be bad,
    but the first and second impression have been a bit lacking. I was also rejected by z fellows after an interview with Baylor. 
    for some reason I got the impression he was hoping I would have more of a certain tech bro personality type thing as we talked.
    On twitter it also seemed many of the people they accepeted kind of fit that mold. somebody said on twitter that they take too much "phineas" type people 
    but not enough "ferb" type people. I don't really remeember the show but I remember phineas was left handed and talked a lot more lol.

    some grant for cloud credits through aws activate from 1517 are still under review. it took 3 follow up emails to get them,
    but things worked. I was prepared to send about 10 follow up emails if necessary, since the expected value is pretty high at the cost of them thinking I'm annoying or rude and some of my time.
    still pending and another few yet to be finished. I have a plane ticket back to Beijing on the 13th with free cancellation, and 
    my collaborator will pay off my plane tickets, so it will be free. and if my paper is accepeted for a talk at qec25, I will also get a free trip
    to yale this summer to take me back to the us. I think staying in the bay area would be more eventful. I don't have much time to decide.
