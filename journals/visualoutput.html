July 5th 2025: today we visited the pixar office. visual output takes a lot of time and effort, and text feels almost effortless in comparison.
I have access to 8xh100s now, but it feels like nothing compared to what is needed to learn a policyf for a good rl algorithm that will work on some of the huge models we use nowadays.
and theres a handful of new problems to think about now with how we should handle updatining the model weights fast and what not, especially in a distributed setting.
also, I recently realized how cheap bio is and have some ideas for how to do that
